Atlas is a compact AI assistant designed to streamline your Windows experience. This intelligent tool simplifies everyday tasks on your PC, leveraging the power of voice recognition.
Effortless Setup and Execution
Getting started with Atlas is a breeze. Simply install the required dependencies using the following command in your command prompt:
# 
pip install -r requirements.txt
# 
Once the dependencies are installed, navigate to the project directory and execute the main.py file to launch Viper.
Compatibility and Flexibility
Atlas is optimized for Python 3.10. However, for users running later versions (3.11 or above), installing setuptools might be necessary. Additionally, some modules were removed in Python 3.12. If you encounter any compatibility issues, feel free to reach out for assistance.
Continuous Improvement
#
This initial release (version 0.1) lays the foundation for future enhancements. We are actively working on integrating either Gemini or OpenAI APIs in version 0.2, further expanding Viper's capabilities.

# 
Administrator Privileges for Enhanced Functionality
To ensure unhindered access to essential directories, please run the command prompt with administrator privileges. Windows enforces restrictions on specific locations, and elevated privileges allow Viper to operate at its full potential.

# Welcome Your Feedback!
We are constantly striving to improve Viper. Your suggestions are always valued. Please feel free to share your thoughts and help us shape the future of this innovative AI assistant.
